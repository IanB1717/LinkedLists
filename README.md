# LinkedLists
This repository will contain files in java which revolve around LinkedLists
1)LinkedListLab9 ------ This file takes a link list of strings and simly returns a one if a loop is found in the linkedList or returns a 0 if there is no loop in the linkedList.
A loop in a Linked List is when the same Link is in the linked list more than once and causes the LinkedList not to output the right values as it is walked through as some 
of the values are repeated over and over. To find the loop there was just a check used to see if two links where the same.If they matched a 1 was returned else if the LinekdList was able to be waked through 
the whole way without needing to return a 1 then then the LinkedList had no repeated links and a 0 was returned.
2)LinkedListLab9Strings ------ This file works the same as the file LinkedListLab9 except when this file detects a loop in your singley ended singley linked linked list it tells you the length of the loop in the list it does this but starting at the first link and advancing through the linkedList and as it does so performs a check against the other data stored in the other links in the list as it does so a counter increases which allows me to see how long the loop in the linkedList is.
