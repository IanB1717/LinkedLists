# LinkedLists
This repository will contain files in java which revolve around LinkedLists
1)LinkedListLab9 ------ This file takes a link list of strings and simly returns a one if a loop is found in the linkedList or returns a 0 if there is no loop in the linkedList.
A loop in a Linked List is when the same Link is in the linked list more than once and causes the LinkedList not to output the right values as it is walked through as some 
of the values are repeated over and over. To find the loop there was just a check used to see if two links where the same.If they matched a 1 was returned else if the LinekdList was able to be waked through 
the whole way without needing to return a 1 then then the LinkedList had no repeated links and a 0 was returned.
